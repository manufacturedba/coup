// Master list of shit I gotta do

- Source control
  -- Maybe some people want to follow along offline [DONE]

- Player assignment mechanism
  -- Let's just use query parameters to determine the player [DONE]
  -- Eventually the lobby will force the tokenized player ID into query parameters. Game will do the mapping to some simple integer so
  players can't jump into each other's display

- Create the coin and character card assets
  -- Coin count [DONE]
  -- Coin can just be a hexagon for now
  -- Character card will be a bordered rectangle with the name for now
